# EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) conducted on cars dataset

I explored car manufacturer distributions, their catalog of engines and power, fuel consumption and transmission trend over the years.

Also this project servers me as a convenient cheatsheet for `pandas` and `matplotlib` related things.

Check out [plots folder](https://github.com/Ardnys/cars-exploratory-analysis/tree/main/plots) for some interesting plots.
